        <p>Hello! I am Jesse Antonio Chi-Su-Gutierrez, and welcome to a slice of me. Being a senior of Pasadena High School, I have had the opportunity to be admitted in the PHS App Academy, a four-year computer science program. Alongside that, I have participated in club activities, being President of Astronomy Club, Vice-President of Leos Club, and a valiant member in Audio Visual Club and Chess Club. I have also been engaged in the National Honors Society as well as the California Scholarship Federation. Beyond school endeavors, I have been in a three-year member of the Pasadena Fire Explorers, a volunteer program training youths to become firefighters.</p>

        <p>The greatest of my 2018 App Academy projects would be my p5-programmed video game. Titled "Brass Blast", the game is a hybrid of classic ball shooter games and drop games. The game is inspired by jazz themes, including sounds from jazz culture (cymbols, brass, beats, etc.) Also installed into the game is a jazz-inspired color palette, furthering the overall theme of the music genre. The game itself is simple: you are a ball, attempting to hit a moving block. If the ball collides with the block, you get a point! If you miss, you lose a life. </p>

        <p>Another one of favorite projects was from AP English Literature and Composition of 2017. As an extra credit opportunity, the teacher required a fully anotated version of a book we requested to read about.
            <br />Truly, this challenging experience reflects my unbreaking attitude when it comes to large projects. My perseverance had excelled my once cautious boundaries.</p>

        <p>Jointly established by the Pasadena Fire Department and the Boy Scouts of America, the Pasadena Fire Explorers is a volunteer service program where youths are trained by firefighters to become firefighters. Serving for over three years, I have immense respect and appreciation for this program.</p>
